# Panel Snapshot Reference

This note clarifies which app routes correspond to panel snapshots used in review conversations:

- **Admin dashboard panel:** `/`
- **User panel (face experience):** `/face`

These routes can be used with Playwright or browser tooling to capture full-page snapshots.


For snapshot validation triage, open `artifacts/gui/frontends-overview.png` first; it provides a labeled one-file overview of `/`, `/face`, and `/face?embed=1` outputs.
